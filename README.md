# L-System-generator-with-flowers-and-leaves

#Based on Unity

#This project aims to create a flexible generator for users to create the graphics by themselves. The ‘flexible’ means users can make their own rules (there are 3 rules can be defined), define the symbols of the line, leaf and flower, define the iteration and they can even choose the textures of leaves and flowers. This project also gives two ways of generating – generate at once and generate by step – so users can see the ‘growth’ of the graphic. There are also some sliders on the top right of the screen for users can rotate, scale and move their graphics. Also, there are several examples (including no-tree shape, with or without leaves and flowers) will be given, users can also create their own graphics based on these examples by modifying parameters of them.

Here is a video on the Youtube to show how to generate turtle graphics by this tool:
